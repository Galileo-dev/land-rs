= Convex Optimisation

For this @fyp I implemented *Successive Convexification for Fuel-Optimal
Powered Landing with Aerodynamic Drag
and Non-Convex Constraints* @Szmuk2016 which formulates @apdg as a successive convexification problem using @sc to handle the non-convex constraints, using a procedure that:
- Make assumptions about the drag and speed profile for the initial trajectory.
- Linearises the non-linear dynamics constraints about a reference trajectory using a first-order Taylor expansion.
- Introduces trust-region and relaxation terms to keep the solution bounded and feasible throughout the convergence process.
- Uses an iterative process by which the problem is repeatedly linearised about a solution obtained from the previous iteration.
- Solve the convexified sub-problemsw using an @ipm solver.


== Problem Formulation
This section formulates the @apdg problem in the @sc style and explains the process of turning these into contraints that Clarabel can solve.

We remove the non-linearities through @sc:
1. *Lossless convexification:* introduces auxiliary variables to linearise the constraints.
2. *linearisation:* Non linearities are removed through the use of a first-order Taylor expansion.
3. *Trust-region and relaxation:* Trust-region contraints are added to bound the decision variables between each iteration.
4. *Iterative Refinement:* For each iteration $i > 0$ the previous solution is used as a linearisation point for the next, until some convergence criteria is met.

We use a thrust vector $T(t)$ as the direction and magnitude of the thrust force for a given timestep $Delta t$.
The goal is to find the optimal thrust vector $T(t)$ that minimises fuel consumption (or maximises final mass) while keeping the rocket on a safe and precise landing trajectory.

== Code Review

Rust is well equipped to handle convex optimisation tasks; a very prominent library, *Clarabel*, is written entirely in pure Rust; this is also used as the default solver for *CVXPY*, a well-regarded Python library for modelling and solving convex optimisation problems.

=== Patching

Clarabel does not offer a modelling language and, as such, requires much reformulation of the problem to fit the specification of the solver. Instead, a patch was applied to a linear programming library, which offers a variety of ways to model and solve linear programming problems; however, it lacked the support for the second-order cone constraint required by the above algorithm @Szmuk2016.

`patch-crate` was used to patch the `good_lp` @good_lp_patch crate to add support for the second-order cone constraints.
The general form of the problem is as follows:

$ min c^T x $

$ "Subject to" quad A x = b, quad x in K $

where:

- $x$ is the decision variable (i.e position, velocity, mass and thrust).
- $c^T x$ is the objective function
- $A x = b$ represents the equality constraints (i.e. vehicle dynamics, fuel mass depletion, glide slope constraints, thrust constraints).
- $K$ represents @soc:pl cone constraints that enforce the thrust direction, minimum glide slope, acceleration limits.

The @soc are defined as:
$ K^n_S = { v in R^n | v_1 â‰¥ || v_(2:n) || } $
