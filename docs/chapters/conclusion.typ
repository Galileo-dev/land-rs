= Interim Conclusion

This section summarizes the progress made so far in comparing convex optimization and @rl approaches for autonomous rocket landing. The development of the simulation environment and implementation of the convex optimization approach provide a solid foundation for the next phase of the project. The @rl implementation and comprehensive comparative analysis will form the focus of the remaining work.
