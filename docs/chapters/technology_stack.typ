= Technology Stack
This chapter describes the various technologies used throughout this project, focusing on the reason for their selection and how they were used. Special priority was given to libraries such as Rust in memory-safe languages.

== Rust

Rust was chosen as a language that offers high-level features with low-level speeds, provides memory safety without a garbage collector and does not allow undefined behaviour @rust_reference_undefined_behavior, making it ideal for safety-critical applications such as running the guidance system of a rocket @Pinho2019.

== Conclusion
The technology stack was chosen to deliver high performance, strong safety guarantees, and a modular architecture allowing easy extensibility. Laying a foundational framework for the future development of safety-critical systems.
