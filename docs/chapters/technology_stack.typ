== Rust

Rust was chosen as a language that offers high-level features with low-level speeds, provides memory safety without a garbage collector and does not allow undefined behaviour @rust_reference_undefined_behavior, making it ideal for safety-critical applications such as running the guidance system of a rocket @Pinho2019.
