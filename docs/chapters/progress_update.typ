== Work Done to Date
- Conducted initial research on the G-FOLD algorithm and convex optimization by reviewing research papers. (Due to current gaps in understanding, I plan to enroll in Stanford EE364A for a deeper dive [boyd_vandenberghe_ee364a].)
- Set up the development environment and project structure using a Cargo workspace, enabling modularity by splitting the project into separate crates.
- Created a prototype of the simulation environment using the Bevy game engine and the Rapier physics engine. The prototype includes a basic wireframe renderer that displays the rocket, ground, and nozzle.
