= Problem Analysis
When a vehicle enters an atmosphere, it encounters several challenges:
- *Friction and Heating:* Most reentry energy is dissipated through friction, leading to extreme heating requiring a heat shield @blackmore2017.
- *Drag:* Significant drag forces affect the vehicle. For example, the Falcon 9 reusable rocket experiences up to 6g deceleration @blackmore2017.
- *High Winds:* Wind speeds can reach 160 km/h causing it to veer off course without real-time feedback. @blackmore2017.
- *Communication Blackouts:* Ionized air can cause temporary communication losses, as experienced by Apollo 13's 6-minute blackout @blackmore2017.
- *Radiation:* High radiation levels impact onboard flight computers and electronics @blackmore2017.

== Small Margin for Error
The first landing attempt must succeed; failure means vehicle destruction on impact. Carrying extra fuel for a second attempt is primarily infeasible. Large rocket engines struggle to throttle down to hover and require continuous propellant to maintain altitude. Most large rockets don't have a low enough minimum throttle, so, during landing, the rocket will have a @twr above zero. When the velocity reaches zero, the rocket will start going back up @blackmore2017.

== Hardware Limits
A successful guidance system must compute divert trajectories without exceeding hardware capabilities or safety constraints. Large rocket engines have thrust constraints preventing hovering, requiring continuous descent to minimize propellant usage @blackmore2017.
