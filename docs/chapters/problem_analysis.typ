= Problem Analysis
The problem is a rocket plummeting through the atmosphere and landing on a specific target. We can only use the rocket's throttleable rocket engine to declerate and manoeuvre the rocket to a specific landing target and speed. During descent, the rocket is subject to several non-linear constraints such as aerodynamic drag, finite fuel and an unspecified flight time @Szmuk2016.


The main problem to address is the generation of a dynamically feasible trajectory for spacecraft and @rlv:pl to land on a specific target safely, while remaining fuel-optimal.

When a vehicle enters the atmosphere, it encounters several challenges:
- *Friction and Heating:* Most reentry energy is dissipated through friction, leading to extreme heating requiring a heat shield @blackmore2017.
- *Drag:* Significant drag forces affect the vehicleâ€”for example, the Falcon 9 reusable rocket experiences up to 6g deceleration @blackmore2017.
- *High Winds:* Wind speeds can reach 160 km/h, causing it to veer off course without real-time feedback. @blackmore2017.
- *Communication Blackouts:* Ionised air can cause temporary communication losses, as experienced by Apollo 13's 6-minute blackout @blackmore2017.
- *Radiation:* High radiation levels impact onboard flight computers and electronics @blackmore2017.


== Trajectory Definition
A trajectory is a temporal state and control signal over time @Malyuta2022. Being "dynamically feasible" means the Trajectory must strictly satisfy the vehicle's dynamics (e.g. equations of motion and actuator limits) at every point. Onboard trajectory generation is crucial, as communication is not always possible.


== Non-convexity
As the introduction mentions, the trajectory generation problem is almost always non-convex. This makes it difficult to efficiently and accurately solve a trajectory generation problem. However, we can apply a systematic approach to handle these non-convex problems and generate a feasible trajectory using a convex solver. The two primary methods are:

- *Lossless Convexification*: involves reformulating the non-convex problem as a convex one through variable substitution and "lifting" the control inputs into a higher-dimensional space @Malyuta2022. Most importantly, the new problem is globally optimal for the original non-convex problem. This is why it is called "lossless convexification (LCvx)", and it can be solved with a single call to a convex solver @Malyuta2022.

- *Sequential convex programming (Successive Convexification)*: involves an iterative process of linearising the non-convex elements about a point obtained from the previous solution. This iteration process stops once a user-defined convergence criterion is met @Szmuk2016.

== Small Margin for Error
The first landing attempt must succeed; failure means vehicle destruction on impact. Carrying extra fuel for a second attempt is primarily infeasible. Large rocket engines struggle to throttle down to hover and require continuous propellant to maintain altitude. Most large rockets do not have a low enough minimum throttle, so, during landing, the rocket will have a @twr above zero. When the velocity reaches zero, the rocket will start moving back up @blackmore2017.

== Hardware Limits
A successful guidance system must compute divert trajectories without exceeding hardware capabilities or safety constraints. Large rocket engines have thrust constraints preventing hovering, requiring continuous descent to minimise propellant usage @blackmore2017.
