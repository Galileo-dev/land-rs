== Introduction
In the past 50 years, autonomous spacecraft have brought humans and satellites to orbit, safely returned humans to Earth, and landed rovers on Mars. Precise landing capability allows missions to land rovers closer to areas of interest @Bonfiglio2011.

Landing an autonomous spacecraft or rocket is challenging, landing within meters of a predetermined target under varying atmospheric conditions is crucial. This precision enables fully reusable rockets, akin to aircraft refuelling and reuse. Commercial companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin have recently demonstrated landings within meters of their targets @blackmore2017.

// TODO: Add more context on why precision landing is important for scientific missions on other planets and how it greatly reduces the cost of RLV's and the time it takes to reach areas of interest on other planets.
