= Future Enhancements

Time was limited when developing this FYP. There are some features I wanted to implement, but due to time constraints, they could not be completed.

Here, I will outline improvements that I would make to the current implementation if I had more time:

- Use #link("https://github.com/eliotbo/bevy_plot")[bevy_plot] to plot the metrics of the algorithm and simulation in real-time.

- Implement @ChenYushu2023AFAf "A Fast Algorithm for Onboard Atmospheric Powered Descent Guidance" to improve the performance of the convex solver.

- Add improvements from @Szmuk_2018 "Successive Convexification for 6-Dof Mars Rocket Powered Landing with Free-Final-Time", which is a more recent algorithm from the same authors as the currently implemented algorithm @Szmuk2016
