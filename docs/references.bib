abstract = { Well before Curiosity’s successful landing at Gale Crater on the night of 5 August 2012, the entry, descent, and landing team had to contend with a number of development challenges that threatened the system architecture, the spacecraft’s performance, and its safety. Given the ambitiousness of the landing system, perhaps it comes as no surprise that these challenges existed in all phases of system development, spanning design, testing, and operations and across all portions of flight from the top of the atmosphere through touchdown. These challenges, which included hardware, software, and flight dynamics issues, required a variety of different responses and wide range of expertise within the team. The ways the team answered the challenges were the difference between success and failure in both reaching the launch pad and reaching the surface of Mars. }

ABSTRACT = {A launch vehicle needs to adapt to a complex flight environment during flight, and traditional guidance and control algorithms can hardly deal with multi-factor uncertainties due to the high dependency on control models. To solve this problem, this paper designs a new intelligent flight control method for a rocket based on the deep reinforcement learning algorithm driven by knowledge and data. In this process, the Markov decision process of the rocket landing section is established by designing a reinforcement function with consideration of the combination effect on the return of the terminal constraint of the launch vehicle and the cumulative return of the flight process of the rocket. Meanwhile, to improve the training speed of the landing process of the launch vehicle and to enhance the generalization ability of the model, the strategic neural network model is obtained and trained via the form of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network combined with a full connection layer as a landing guidance strategy network. The proximal policy optimization (PPO) is the training algorithm of reinforcement learning network parameters combined with behavioral cloning (BC) as the reinforcement learning pre-training imitation learning algorithm. Notably, the rocket-borne environment is transplanted to the Nvidia Jetson TX2 embedded platform for the comparative testing and verification of this intelligent model, which is then used to generate real-time control commands for guiding the actual flying and landing process of the rocket. Further, comparisons of the results obtained from convex landing optimization and the proposed method in this work are performed to prove the effectiveness of this proposed method. The simulation results show that the intelligent control method in this work can meet the landing accuracy requirements of the launch vehicle with a fast convergence speed of 84 steps, and the decision time is only 2.5 ms. Additionally, it has the ability of online autonomous decision making as deployed on the embedded platform.},

abstract = {Apollo Lunar-descent Guidance transfers the Lunar Module from a near-circular orbit to touchdown, traversing 17° central angle and 15 km altitude in 11 min. A group of interactive programs in an onboard computer guide the descent, controlling altitude and the descent propulsion system throttle. A ground-based program precomputes guidance targets. This paper describes the concepts involved. Explicit and implicit guidance are discussed, guidance equations are derived, and the earlier Apollo explicit equation is shown to be an inferior special case of the later implicit equation. The paper describes interactive guidance by which the two-man crew selects a landing site in favorable terrain and directs the trajectory there. Interactive terminal-descent guidance enables the crew to control the essentially vertical descent rate in order to land in minimum time with safe contact speed. The attitude maneuver routine uses concepts that make gimbal lock inherently impossible. The throttle routine yields zero steady-state thrust-acceleration error or avoids operation within a thrust region forbidden because of hardware limitations. The ground-based program precomputes guidance targets which shape the trajectory to produce an efficient descent with adequate visibility and no transients at the final phasic interface.
Résumé
Le guidage de la descente lunaire d'Apollo transfère le module lunaire d'une orbite quasi circulaire à l'atterrisage en traversant un angle central de 17° et une altitude de 15km en 11 minutes. Un groupe de programmes interactifs sur un ordinateur de bord guide la descente en contrôlant l'attitude et l'accélération du système de propulsion pour la descente. Un programme basé sur terre précalcul les objectifs de guidage. Ce texte décrit les concepts impliqués. Les guidages explicites et implicites sont discutés, les équations de guidage sont dérivées, et l'équation explicite de l'Apollo précédent est montrée être un cas spécial inférieur de la dernière équation implicite. La texte décrit le guidage interactif par lequel l'équipage de deux hommes choisit un lieu d'atterrissage sur terrain favorable et y dirige la trajectoire. Le guidage de descente terminale interactif permet à l'équipage de contrôler le taux essentiellement vertical de descente afin d'atterrir dans un temps minimum à une vitesse de contact acceptable. La routine de la manoeuvre d'attitude utilise des concepts qui rendent pratiquement impossible le verrouillage du cardan. La routine de l'étrangleur donne une erreure nulle de l'accélération de poussée en état d'équilibre ou bien évite une opération dans une région de poussée défendue de fait des limitations imposées par le matériel. Le programme basé sur terre précalcule les objectifs de guidage qui forment la trajectoire pour Eealiser une descente efficace avec bonne visibilité et sans transitions à l'interface phasique finale.
Zusammenfassung
Die Führung bei der Apollo-Mondlandung leitet die Mond-Baueinheit von einer nahezu kreisförmigen Bahn aus zum Absetzplatz hin, wobei sie einen Winkelbogen von 17° und eine Höhe von 15 km in 11 Minuten durchläuft. Eine Gruppe von Programmen, die in einem Bordrechner zusammenarbeiten, leiten den Abstieg, kontrollieren die Höhe und das Stellglied beim Abstiegsantriebssystem. Ein auf den Boden bezogenes Programm berechnet die Ziele der Führung im voraus. Die Arbeit beschreibt die enthaltenen Konzepte. Diskutiert wird die explizite und die implizite Führung, und die Gleichungen für den Vorgang der Führung werden abgeleitet. Gezeigt wird, da ß die früheren expliziten Gleichungen ein ungünstigerer spezieller Fall der späteren impliziten Gleichung sind. Beschrieben wird die Führung mit Wechselwirkung, wobei die Zweier-Mannschaft einen Landeplatz in günstigem Terrain aussucht und die Bahn dahin ausrichtet. Die Führung zum Abstiegsende mit Wechselwirkung befähigt die Mannschaft, den wesentlich vertikalen Anteil des Abstiegs zu steuern, um in minimaler Zeit mit zulässiger Kontaktgeschwindigkeit zu landen. Das Verhalten bei dem Routine-Manöver benutzt Konzepte, die eine Kardanblockierung von vornherein unmöglich machen. Die Routine bei der Betätigung des Stellgliedes ergibt stationäre Schubbeschleunigungsfehler von Null oder vermeidet eine Arbeitsweise innerhalb eines wegen der hardware-Begrenzungengen verbotenen Schubbereiches. Das auf den Boden bezogene Programm berechnet im voraus die Ziele der Führung, die die Bahn so gestalten, daß ein wirksamer Abstieg mit adäquatem Sichtbereich und unter Verminderung von Übergängen bei der schlieβlichen Übergangsstelle erreicht wird.

    abstract = { Onboard, fuel-optimal, constrained powered-descent guidance based on the theory of lossless convexification has been implemented as the Guidance for Fuel-Optimal Large Diverts (G-FOLD) algorithm. Here, “guidance” means generating feedforward reference trajectories for control systems. This paper presents terrestrial flight-test demonstrations of large diverts planned by G-FOLD onboard a vertical-takeoff/vertical-landing rocket. The G-FOLD parser, which transforms the guidance problem into a second-order cone program and so encodes the divert constraints, is described at an engineering level, including new and modified constraints incorporated for these flight tests. Several practical issues, such as discretization effects, are addressed, and the flight-test architecture is presented. A total of eight flight tests were performed. In the first three, the rocket executed diverts of increasing size preplanned by G-FOLD on the ground. Then G-FOLD was demonstrated running onboard five times. Three qualitatively different types of diverts were performed, demonstrating G-FOLD over a nontrivial area of the “phase space” of divert boundary conditions. With one exception not involving G-FOLD, the rocket then followed diverts planned onboard to meter-level precision, consistent with preflight performance predictions. These flight tests are believed to be the first demonstrations of large diverts with constrained, onboard powered-descent guidance, readying the way for adoption of G-FOLD by future missions. }

abstract = {Atmospheric powered descent guidance (APDG) can be solved by successive convexification; however, its onboard application is impeded by high computational cost. When aerodynamic forces are ignored, powered descent guidance (PDG) can be converted to a single convex problem. In contrast, APDG has to be converted into a sequence of convex subproblems, each of which is significantly more complicated. Consequently, the computation increases sharply. A fast real-time interior point method was presented to solve the correlated convex subproblems efficiently onboard in the work. The main contributions are as follows: Firstly, an algorithm was proposed to accelerate the solution of linear systems that cost most of the computation in each iterative step by exploiting the specific problem structure. Secondly, a warm-starting scheme was introduced to refine the initial value of a subproblem with a rough approximate solution of the former subproblem, which lessened the iterative steps required for each subproblem. The method proposed reduced the run time by a factor of 9 compared with the fastest publicly available solver tested in Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the efficiency of solvers. Runtimes on the order of 0.6 s are achieved on a radiation-hardened flight processor, which demonstrated the potential of the real-time onboard application.},

abstract={CVXGEN is a software tool that takes a high level description of a convex optimization problem family, and automatically generates custom C code that compiles into a reliable, high speed solver for the problem family. The current implementation targets problem families that can be transformed, using disciplined convex programming techniques, to convex quadratic programs of modest size. CVXGEN generates simple, flat, library-free code suitable for embedding in real-time applications. The generated code is almost branch free, and so has highly predictable run-time behavior. The combination of regularization (both static and dynamic) and iterative refinement in the search direction computation yields reliable performance, even with poor quality data. In this paper we describe how CVXGEN is implemented, and give some results on the speed and reliability of the automatically generated solvers.},

abstract = {Rocket reusability dates as long as rockets. Since the beginning of space age, the possibility to reuse the full vehicle or some stages has been a matter of engineering. But this was directly opposite to mass ratio efficiency, the key for a well-designed rocket. Since as soon as a stage has to be recovered, subsystems to provide this function and additional inert mass are needed. Even if reusable systems are only a small part of the worldwide rockets, they flew operationally since the space shuttle age. However, full reusable vehicles are not yet operational and only partially reusable launch vehicles have been flown until now. The preliminary space shuttle design consisted of two stages both liquid and reusable (booster and orbiter stages). The consolidated design retrieved the orbiter (upper stage, the cargo and propulsion bay) and the solid rocket boosters. On Russian side Energia-Buran only retrieved the upper stage with its cargo bay and the same approach was adapted for the original design of Ariane 5-Hermes. Europe investigated and developed different reusable systems, set up test facilities and flew the IXV demonstrator in 2015. More recently, the preferred strategy consists in reuse of unwinged booster stages (e.g. Falcon 9 of SpaceX) or of only the orbited spacecraft (e.g. NASA-USAF X-37). France and Europe are preparing propulsion and reusable rocket stage demonstration bricks for next generation launchers. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of some reusable space systems with emphasis on the different design strategy and skills mainly focused on European heritage. The systems are split into low and high energy with a view to technology aspects and in-flight experiments.}

abstract = {Precision landing on large and small planetary bodies is a technology of utmost importance for future human and robotic exploration of the solar system. In this context, the Zero-Effort-Miss/Zero-Effort-Velocity (ZEM/ZEV) feedback guidance algorithm has been studied extensively and is still a field of active research. The algorithm, although powerful in terms of accuracy and ease of implementation, has some limitations. Therefore with this paper we present an adaptive guidance algorithm based on classical ZEM/ZEV in which machine learning is used to overcome its limitations and create a closed loop guidance algorithm that is sufficiently lightweight to be implemented on board spacecraft and flexible enough to be able to adapt to the given constraint scenario. The adopted methodology is an actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the parameters of the above-mentioned guidance architecture according to the given problem constraints.}

abstract = {This work develops a deep reinforcement learning based approach for Six Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) planetary powered descent and landing. Future Mars missions will require advanced guidance, navigation, and control algorithms for the powered descent phase to target specific surface locations and achieve pinpoint accuracy (landing error ellipse <5 m radius). This requires both a navigation system capable of estimating the lander’s state in real-time and a guidance and control system that can map the estimated lander state to a commanded thrust for each lander engine. In this paper, we present a novel integrated guidance and control algorithm designed by applying the principles of reinforcement learning theory. The latter is used to learn a policy mapping the lander’s estimated state directly to a commanded thrust for each engine, resulting in accurate and almost fuel-optimal trajectories over a realistic deployment ellipse. Specifically, we use proximal policy optimization, a policy gradient method, to learn the policy. Another contribution of this paper is the use of different discount rates for terminal and shaping rewards, which significantly enhances optimization performance. We present simulation results demonstrating the guidance and control system’s performance in a 6-DOF simulation environment and demonstrate robustness to noise and system parameter uncertainty.}

abstract={This paper focuses on improving the autonomy and efficiency of fuel-optimal powered landing guidance for reusable rockets considering aerodynamic forces. Deep-learning-based methods are developed to enable online and autonomous operation ability and to avoid the convergence problem encountered by classic indirect and direct optimal control methods. Considering the complex uncertainties of the preceding entry flight and potential unsettling hand-over conditions, a classification network is designed to classify the initial states of landing flights into different categories that correspond to bang--bang or non-bang--bang/singular thrust profiles. Thus, the subsequent online regression network can perform well for a large initial state distribution, and the algorithm adjusts to extensive landing situations. The combined application of classification and regression networks is one of the main contributions of the paper. The offline trained state-action regression networks generate guidance commands according to the real-time rocket state, obtaining a near-optimal landing trajectory. In addition, an online parallel trajectory simulation strategy is proposed to verify the trajectory quality, and an alternative trajectory optimization procedure is embedded into the proposed network-based framework to enhance the safety and accuracy of the guidance algorithm, representing another major contribution. Numerical experiments are presented to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {The planetary landing problem is gaining relevance in the space sector, spanning a wide range of applications from unmanned probes landing on other planetary bodies to reusable first and second stages of launcher vehicles. In the existing methodology there is a lack of flexibility in handling complex non-linear dynamics, in particular in the case of non-convexifiable constraints. It is therefore crucial to assess the performance of novel techniques and their advantages and disadvantages. The purpose of this work is the development of an integrated 6-DOF guidance and control approach based on reinforcement learning of deep neural network policies for fuel-optimal planetary landing control, specifically with application to a launcher first-stage terminal landing, and the assessment of its performance and robustness. 3-DOF and 6-DOF simulators are developed and encapsulated in MDP-like (Markov Decision Process) industry-standard compatible environments. Particular care is given in thoroughly shaping reward functions capable of achieving the landing both successfully and in a fuel-optimal manner. A cloud pipeline for effective training of an agent using a PPO reinforcement learning algorithm to successfully achieve the landing goal is developed.}

abstract = {The process of identifying the landing site for NASA's Mars 2020 rover began in 2013 by defining threshold mission science criteria related to seeking signs of ancient habitable conditions, searching for biosignatures of past microbial life, assembling a returnable cache of samples for possible future return to Earth, and collecting data for planning eventual human missions to the surface of Mars. Mission engineering constraints on elevation and latitude were used to identify candidate landing sites that addressed the scientific objectives of the mission. However, for the first time these constraints did not have a major influence on the viability of candidate sites and, with the new entry, descent, and landing capabilities included in the baseline mission, the vast majority of sites were evaluated and down-selected on the basis of science merit. More than 30 candidate sites with likely acceptable surface and atmospheric conditions were considered at a series of open workshops in the years leading up to the launch. During that period, iteration between engineering constraints and the evolving relative science potential of candidate sites led to the identification of three final candidate sites: Jezero crater (18.4386°N, 77.5031°E), northeast (NE) Syrtis (17.8899°N,77.1599°E) and Columbia Hills (14.5478°S, 175.6255°E). The final landing site will be selected by NASA's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate. This paper serves as a record of landing site selection activities related primarily to science, an inventory of the number and variety of sites proposed, and a summary of the science potential of the highest-ranking sites.}

A large fraction of the Jezero Crater landing site was covered with landing hazards including cliffs, inescapable dune fields and rocks. These hazards were identified or inferred using orbital imagery before launch so that they could be avoided using Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) which was composed of two parts: the Lander Vision System (LVS) and Safe Target Selection (STS). During EDL, the LVS successfully estimated map relative position by fusing landmarks matched between descent imagery and a map of the landing site with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. This position estimate was used by STS to identify the safest target for landing that was also reachable given fuel and other constraints. The EDL system then used the powered descent phase to retarget to this location and land safely. The overall error between the targeted location and actual landing location was 5m which was an order of magnitude less than the 60m touchdown error requirement. This paper will describe the final tests of the LVS before launch, the checkout of the LVS during operations and the LVS performance during EDL. }
